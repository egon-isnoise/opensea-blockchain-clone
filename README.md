A clone of OpenSea using react, next.js, tailwind and Sanity.io.

The project calls NFTs stored in Sanity.io servers. 
Some of the NFT that can be seen throught the "COLLECTIONS" keyword in the upper nav can be "purchased", these are the ones with a price expressed in ETH.
Something goes wrong with the actual call of the smart contract tho, as opening the console clearly shows the action was reverted due to infinite GAS.
I did not keep on trying to fix the issue as I started this project mainly to learn more about React and next.js.

I am not really a fan of the way Sanity.io works. Seems overcomplicated with no added benefit compared to Pinata and Infura.
